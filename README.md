# CRAM Decay Solvers (16th and 48th Order)

This repository contains two Python scripts that demonstrate the use of Chebyshev Rational Approximation Method (CRAM) to solve radioactive decay problems for a single nuclide (e.g., U-235).

## Files

- `cram16_decay_solver.py`: Implements the 16th-order CRAM approximation.
- `cram48_decay_solver.py`: Implements the 48th-order CRAM approximation.

## Purpose

The scripts simulate the decay of a single isotope over time and compare the CRAM solution to the analytical exponential decay solution. These techniques are widely used in depletion calculations in Monte Carlo codes such as OpenMC and Serpent.
